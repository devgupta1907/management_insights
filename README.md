# Consumer Domain Management Insights Report

I successfully concluded the Management Insights Project under the purview of codebasics Resume Projects.

This undertaking has not only honed my proficiency in SQL to resolve targeted business predicaments but has also enhanced my aptitude for effectively communicating the derived insights to key stakeholders.

Throughout this endeavor, I employed MySQL as a robust data analysis tool, leveraged Power BI to generate visually appealing representations, and utilized Canva to meticulously craft an engaging presentation.
